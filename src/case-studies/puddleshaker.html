                    <p>Design.local is an online design community focused on helping Waterloo's non-for-profit business
                        through design. Design.local is rebranding to Puddleshaker and this website was re-designed as a
                        part of Design.local’s rebranding initiative. For the competition, we were given a brand guide,
                        logo, and site architecture, and stakeholder requirements. We were asked to create a
                        high-fidelity prototype and a site map.</p>

                <h4 class="line">Problem Space</h4>
                <div>
                    <p>The problem space given was that the original website did not have an efficient virtual outreach
                        towards local designers, corporate sponsors, and community partners. However, our team believed
                        that the problem that exists is more complex than simply what was given. We have to dive deeper
                        into this issue and understand why this occurs.<br />
                        <br /><strong>This stems from:</strong><br /><br />
                        1. The lack of visual, structural, and thematic differentiation between all sections of the
                        website and the rest of the website.
                        <br /> 2. A generic website template.

                        Per our design goals, some of our most notable design decisions were:
                        <br /><br /><strong>1. Creating different pages for each user (Corporate sponsors, community
                            partners, and local designers) which can be accessed easily through the navigation
                            bar.</strong>

                        Creating different pages addresses our design goal of “differentiable pages of each target user”
                        as it makes all facets of Design.local (a.k.a PuddleShaker) accessible to our different users.

                        of their core values and is illustrated beautifully through their name. Telling this story
                        emphasizes the backstory behind the organization and fulfills our second design goal.

                        decided to go with a brighter, more saturated colour scheme as it is more uplifting and visually
                        appealing.

                    <p>One of the biggest challenges for this project was staying within the specified timeline. Typical
                        designs take months to perfect but we only had 48 hours. To overcome this challenge we followed
                        our site map which we created at the beginning of the competition. This helped us stay organized
                        throughout the design process.</p>
