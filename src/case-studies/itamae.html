                        using a step by step process.</p>

                    <p>I love to cook, so naturally, the inspiration behind itamae comes from the blunders I have
                        experienced in the kitchen. In paticular, my inspiration comes from the following pain points;
                        firstly, it is tedious to access recipe steps from online blogs. It is time-consuming and
                        frustrating to scroll all the way to the bottom of a webpage, through paragraphs of text, to
                        find the recipe. Secondly, it is tedious to access recipe steps from online blogs. It is

                    <p>I began the user research process by creating a proto-persona using myself and my own beliefs.
                        Next, to gauge a better scope of potential user demographics other than myself, I created a user
                        survey and shared it with my friends and family. I found that another viable user demographic is
                        40-60-year-old women. With this new information, I interview 2 women of that age and created a
                        persona using the data I collected. After that, I created a simple user journey map to inform
                        the necessary screens for the app. This will ensure a guided flow without redunant and confusing
                        steps.</p>

                        entire process was the utilization of a guided recipe screen. This screen tackles most the
                        problems identified. It makes recipes easier to read by showing only one step at a time. It also
                        motivates users to reach the end of the recipe by showing them the step they are on (Endowned

                <div>
                    <p>One major challenge that I faced during this process was researcher bias. Since I am part of the
                        target demographic it was tempting at times to stray from the design methodology and take
                        shortcuts. For example, I was tempted to not continue with the Persona creation and just stop at
                        the proto-persona. However, if I had stopped there I would not have discovered another huge user
                        demographic of older women.
                        <br/>
                        From this experience, I have learned so many new skills, from sharing and analyzing user
                        surveys, to creating design systems, and designing a mobile app with technical constraints
                        (because I will be building it soon!).
                        <br/>
                        I also learned many useful theories and methodologies such as the TRIZ problem definition, and
                        Endowned Progress Effect which says that artificial advancement towards a goal make users more
                        likely to want to achieve the goal.
                        <br/>
                        Finally, I learned that the goal of designing is more than just creating a beautiful interface.
                        It is about creating proactive technology that takes initiative and guides the user to their
                        goal.</p>
